<h1>JWTOfficehunter</h1>
A Python-based research tool designed to identify and extract JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) from text-based memory dumps generated by Windows desktop applications. It leverages regular expressions to locate token-like patterns, decodes their payloads for inspection, and highlights tokens associated with Microsoft 365 services. This project demonstrates the security risks of sensitive authentication data residing in application memory and emphasizes the importance of securing endpoints, monitoring memory artifacts, and protecting against credential/token leakage.
